# BIOS625
The final project will be completed in groups. The groups will be self-organized, with three to four students in each group. Each group will identify a big public dataset of interest, propose a question of interest related to the dataset of choice, perform analysis on the dataset of choice to address the question of interest. It is expected that there will be some computational challenges involved in the project, which require the use of some computational techniques learned in (or outside) the lectures of Biostat 625.
